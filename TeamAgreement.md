# Team Agreement

## Team Members

* Anthony Cunningham
* Paul Brown

### Cooperation plan

1. What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

  * Paul Brown - Innovative thinker and creative idealist. A tenacious work ethic, level-headed demeanor, and a passion for knowledge make him a vital asset. 
  * Anthony Cunningham - Resilient, flexible, adaptable. Not afraid to step into leadership roles when necessary, but also not afraid to follow. Outside-the-box thinking, resourcefulness, and great with speaking to others and delegating tasks.

2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
   
   * By combining both of our strengths and being able to prioritize key tasks and MVP features + goals.
  
3. In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
     * Anthony - Technical Competency and Process Competency
     * Paul - Constant Improvement Competency
  
4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
   
   * By maintaining an open channel of dialogue between both individuals in order to understand where we are in our current tasks and push/pull one another as necessary.
  
### Conflict Plan and Resolution

1. What will be your group's process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
   
   * Discuss our conflict like adults and find a common ground to deliberate our ideas, sort out the root cause of the issue(s)
   * If the above method results in failure or a breakdown in communication, the problem will be brought to an instructor for further assistance
  
2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
   
     * I will refer to the above question for this answer as there are only two individuals on the team, therefore the approach should be the same.

3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

    * This was communicated previously before our team was formed. We both have a mutual understanding that the scope of the project is generally out of both of our individual comfort zones, and therefore we are both of the understanding that it is vital to support one another at potential stuck points.
  
4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

   * Considering there are only two members of the team, one will have to tell the other.
  
5. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccesful?

   * An instructor will be notified
